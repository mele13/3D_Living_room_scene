# 3D Living Room Scene

Welcome to the 3D Living Room Scene project! This project showcases a simple interactive 3D environment of a living room where you can explore and interact with various objects. The scene is built using WebGL and features basic 3D rendering, object movement, collision detection, and user input handling.

**Please Note: This project is developed solely for a university project.**

## Features
- Rendered using WebGL, creating a 3D living room scene.
- Objects can be added to the scene with specified positions.
- Object movement and rotation are implemented.
- Basic collision detection with the walls and floor is included.
- Interact with objects and navigate the scene.
- Object shooting mechanics implemented.
- Player viewpoint and bird's-eye viewpoint modes available.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mele13/3D_Living_room_scene.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd FSM
   ```
2. Open the project in a suitable development environment or web server.
3. Open the `cube3d.html` file in a modern web browser that supports WebGL (e.g. Chrome) or use Live Server extension with VS Code.

## Usage
Player view:
- Use the mouse to navigate the scene and rotate the camera.
- Arrow keys 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' can be used for movement (forward, left, backward, right).

Hawk eye:
- Mouse wheel can be used to zoom in and out.
- Left mouse button to rotate objects in the scene.
- Interact with objects using the mouse or keyboard as per the implemented mechanics.

## Controls
- Mouse movement: Rotate the camera/viewpoint.
- Arrow key 'W': Move forward.
- Arrow key 'A': Move left.
- Arrow key 'S': Move backward.
- Arrow key 'D': Move right.
- Mouse wheel: Zoom in and out.
- Left mouse button: Rotate objects.
